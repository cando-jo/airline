python3 manage.py makemigrations
- After adding a class, we have to make a migration

python3 manage.py migrate
- To apply all migrations (Push gibi)

python3 manage.py shell
- Runs the django shell

shell commands:
creating an object
- f = Flight(origin="<origin>", destination="<destination>", duration=<id>)
- f.save() 

showing current objects in a table
- <model/table name>.objects.all()

we can declare a variable which stores a particular flight or all flights:
- flights = Flight.objects.all()
- flight = flights.first() #Stores first flight that was created
- flight.id #Gives us the id, same fore flight.origin or flight.destination
- flight.delete() #Delete the flight from the database















What is a migration?
- Apply the changes we make to the models and add these changes to the database.
